## 🌐 Project Overview

Climate change represents long-term shifts in global temperature patterns, driven mainly by human activities like fossil fuel consumption and deforestation. This project helps visualize and analyze these changes, enabling us to predict future weather patterns and better understand the environmental impact.

We’ll explore climate data from 1960 to 2020, examining trends with libraries like `pandas` and `seaborn`, and then forecast weather patterns for the coming five years using `Prophet`. Let’s take a closer look at what we’ll be doing:
